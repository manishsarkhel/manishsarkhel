My research interests lie at the interface of Supply Chain and Networks. At a broad level, I am working on certain theoretical aspects of the application of game theory to supply chains and networks. More specifically, on studying the strategic interactions among agents embedded in networks. The research questions in this regard involve studying the emergence of specific networks structures among agents given that the agents make rational decisions. 

My teaching interests lie in the domain of Operations Management and Analytics. I teach courses such as operations management, supply chain management, service operations management, modelling with spreadsheets, Python programming, data analytics using Python & R, financial analytics using Python, Excel and visual analytics using PowerBI and Tableau.
